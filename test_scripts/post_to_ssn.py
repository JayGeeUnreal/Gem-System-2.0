# 1. Get your Session ID from the Social Stream Ninja app settings under "Server API".

# 2. Specify the target platform (e.g., "discord", "youtube", "twitch").

# 3. The message you want to send.

# --- API Request Preparation ---

# Construct the full API endpoint URL.

# Create the JSON payload.

    "action": "sendChat",

# We'll explicitly define the one we are setting.

# --- What is being sent ---
# This section prints a representation of the raw HTTP request.

print(f"POST /{session_id} HTTP/1.1")

# 2. Print the Host Header (derived from the URL)

for key, value in headers.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# The `requests` library will also add its own User-Agent and other headers automatically.
# This printout shows the most critical parts you are controlling.

# 4. Print a blank line to separate headers from the body

# 5. Print the JSON body, nicely formatted
# Use json.dumps to convert the Python dictionary to a JSON formatted string
